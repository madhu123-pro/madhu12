	Concept:
</h1>
<div class="boxed">
 The aim of our project is to design a database for a faculties and their research papers and their research scholars in a institute.
	In this dbms model, when we try to click on the faculty we can get their research papers and their research scholars.Each faculty has his own unique faculty-id and each scholar has his own sid.A faculty can have a multiple scholars and a scholar has only one faculty and the research paper can be written by morethan one faculty.But one faculty writes a paper.
